title: HektAR â€” A Game About Food and Land
permalink: /posts/hektar-game/

### Introduction

During my time at Playful Interactive Environments, a research lab at the University of Applied Sciences Upper Austria, I worked on a variety of game projects with an educational purpose. In the case of HektAR, I was responsible for the concept, development, and publishing and was supported by a 3D artist, who took care of visuals, and a team of environmental experts, who provided a lot of the data and content for the game. Creating the entire game took around 1200 hours.

### Overview

In HektAR, players take control of a small virtual farm to meet the needs of a growing community as sustainably as possible. Resources such as land, water, and labor can be used to grow various crops and buy and care for animals. The game addresses food production topics and weather events caused by climate change. Players learn about the demand for agricultural products, seasonality, soil degradation, water consumption, and animal care. At the same time, increasing production introduces climate change phenomena like droughts, pests, and diseases, forcing players to make tough choices.

### Gameplay

The game is played over several years (rounds) and consists of phases:
- **Annual Planning**: Select meals, plan resources, and set production goals.
- **Production**: Plant and harvest crops, manage livestock, and allocate water and labor efficiently.
- **Annual Review**: Evaluate achievements, community growth, and sustainability metrics.

Players face challenges like weather events, pests, and soil quality degradation, making sustainability key.

### Data

Creating a realistic simulation was a challenge. Environmental advisors helped provide estimates on crop yield, water consumption, and resource use. Simplified numbers made gameplay accessible for students while showcasing real-world relationships.

### Summary

HektAR was an exciting project blending education and entertainment. It introduced players to agricultural challenges, resource management, and climate change concepts in a fun and engaging way.
