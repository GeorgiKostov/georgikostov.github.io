<p>Finally got my hands on an <strong>AVP</strong> one year after it came out (and the hype is long gone :)).<br />
I’ve seen a lot about it, so I knew what to expect, but I was still surprised by a few things. Here are some of my impressions.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>It’s amazing for watching 3D movies.</strong><br />
It gives you a perfectly aligned stereo view and amazing brightness + sharpness, something you can’t get to this level even in an IMAX cinema. The sound is also really good.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Ergonomics are BAD.</strong><br />
Really front-heavy, definitely feel the fatigue after 30 min. Combined with a third-party head strap, it might be better, but they need to reduce the weight by a lot.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Eye + hand tracking works really well, as expected.</strong><br />
UX is mostly well done, although I sometimes struggled to place menus properly (no snapping), and the home button seemed to have a mind of its own.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>SHARING the headset is HARD.</strong><br />
It does not detect a new user (and automatically set up the eye tracking for them). Instead, you need to dig through menus, set up a guest account, etc.<br />
Especially <strong>UNUSABLE</strong> if you want to demo something at an event where you might have dozens of people in an hour.<br />
I wonder how long the <strong>IPD motors</strong> last if you push them all day.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Yes, there are some immersive apps</strong>—stuff we’ve seen on any other platform in the last ten years (glorified 3D model viewers)—but it really <strong>NEEDS CONTROLLERS.</strong><br />
If you want to utilize the full potential of immersive apps and more complex interactions, you can’t go full eye/hand tracking. Look at the complexity of the experiences on Meta headsets.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>3D photos and videos are AMAZING</strong>—one of the killer features for me, especially imagining what will soon be possible with AI, NERFs, etc.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Connecting a MacBook and multitasking in the headset worked GREAT!</strong><br />
Still can’t imagine working in the headset due to <strong>EYE FATIGUE</strong> and ergonomics.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The dial knob (volume and switching VR → MR) has NO HAPTICS.</strong><br />
I imagined a slight vibration or slight resistance when turning the dial, which would make it a lot more satisfying.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The front screen is useless, weird, and barely visible.</strong><br />
Cut it and save some weight and cost.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The FOV with the default face pad is really narrow</strong>, feels like a scuba mask.<br />
I tried wearing it without it, and it was so much better—with added peripheral vision and having eyes closer to the lenses, the mixed reality content blends much better.<br />
Otherwise, it feels like a weird mix of a VR headset that tries really hard to not be a VR headset.<br />
<strong>Smaller face pad and no peripheral blockers is the way.</strong></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="final-verdict"><strong>Final Verdict</strong></h3>
<p>Overall, I liked it as a <strong>3D TV</strong> and for <strong>recording 3D footage</strong>, not much else.<br />
<strong>4,000 euros?</strong> Definitely not worth it—get a <strong>Meta Quest</strong> for 10 times less and you can do a lot more.</p>
