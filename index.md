# Welcome to My Portfolio

In my professional experience, I have worked on XR games, digital twins, and simulations with topics such as education, climate change, agriculture, logistics, city planning, sport, health, and civil courage. I am an experienced Unity3D developer with 10 years of practice in every stage of game development â€“ concept, design, programming, UX, graphics, publishing, and analytics. In addition, I am a lecturer, guiding and mentoring several student projects each year.

In my free time, I love traveling, cycling, hiking, swimming, and spending time with friends and family. I am an avid gamer, sometimes write film critiques, and always aim to learn something new about the world, which I can reflect in my projects.
